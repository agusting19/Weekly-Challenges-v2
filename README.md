# Weekly Challenges

In this repository i will be uploading my solutions to the weekly challenges of [MoureDev](https://retosdeprogramacion.com/semanales2022) as a practice.

Those challenges are good for keeping a coding journal so you don't lose practice.

## `Considerations`

This challenges started a few months ago so my goal is to do one or more daily challenges.
I will use React to make it faster so I can scale the project in the future.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
